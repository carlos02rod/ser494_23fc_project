#### SER494: Project Proposal
#### Inflation: its effects on consumer goods and confidence

#### 09-04-2024


#### Keywords: 
consumer-confidence, inflation, economic-stability


#### Description: 
This project will analyze the effects of inflation on key consumer goods categories such as fuel, groceries, and household bills, assessing how these rising costs affect consumer behavior. The analysis will focus on identifying general patterns in how prices in these categories have changed with inflation and seeing if we can predict these changes. In addition, the project will compare these results with consumer confidence indexes to understand whether consumer spending behavior aligns with economic outlook, especially during times of duress and uncertainty. 


#### Intellectual Merit: 
This comparison will help us identify whether there is a noticeable discrepancy between rising costs and consumer spending trends, giving us insights into consumer resilience or strain under pressure. Uncovering potential patterns into how consumers reach can help us in developing a key(line of resistance) in which we can create a threshold where things might go south and be able to predict outcomes or tipping points in each of our 3 categories. With this insight we are able to see thresholds where things appear to be "over-extended", "stable", and "dire". in simpler terms, we would like to simplify this data so patterns are easily recognizable.


#### Data Sourcing: 
Below I outlined some of the data that can possibly be used. Alot of this data is available publicly by the US government, one of those being the Federal Reserve which will be one of our main data retrieval points because of its influence on the economy and industries. Sticking to data provided to us by government bureaus will help us in keeping the data consistent and without much fault.

Consumer Expenditure Survey: 
gives us official data from the government within many categories, some of those being Income before taxes, Consumer price data, employment data, etc.

Federal Reserve Economic Data: 
gives us official inflation data, along with interest rates and consumer data

Bureau of Economic Analysis: 
Provides official data on consumption/price data on sectors pertaining to consumers (gas, groceries, bills)

Why Is Food Still So Expensive? - Taryn Phaneuf, others factors attribute to increased prices and this article outlines some of those and even those attributes have reasons of their own, but they all have a root problem and I hope it has to do with inflation not just for consumers for industries trying to save pennies on the dollar.

# Introduction
This repository contains files for the individual course project in
SER494: Data Science for Software Engineers (fall 2024) created
by ANONYMOUS for partial fulfillment of the course requirements.
At this time, this project has not been cleared by the course staff (R. Acuna) for
public release, and must be kept within a private repository.
